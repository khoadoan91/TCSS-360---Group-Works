**Discussion summary:** We discussed how we would consolidate our user stories into a master story list and how we would write out our storyboard. The user stories will be organized by user and then further sub catercorized. This will make deciding what functionalities should prioritized easier. We confirmed that we would be meeting on tuesdays after class because it would give us a week to complete our designated tasks. 
We decided to have each member handle a user story storyboard with Nina doing the two calendar related ones, while I (Nabil) consolidated and organized the user stories from each member.
