**Discussion summary:** This was our first meeting so we followed the meeting agenda given to us by the instructor. We introduced ourselves and exchanged phone numbers and email addresses and decided that we will communicate through a Google Hangouts group. We also decided to hold our weekly meetings on Tuesdays after class, with the exception of this week on which we will meet on Thursday instead. We will hold our meetings in the WPH mezzanine. We then talked about the upcoming check-in and deliverable and what we will need to accomplish for each deadline. The following is the start of a list of tasks we will need to complete: 

- Set up a group website or Google doc.
- Set up a group email address. 
- Set up a shared GitHub repository.
- Compile our individual homework into a master user story list. 
- Create a storyboard. 

The first two tasks will be done before our next meeting on Thursday while the other three tasks we will begin after the next meeting since we will need to attend class first to learn about GitHub and storyboards.
